		<h1> Architecture of WWW </h1>
		<p class="highlight">
			The WWW today is a distributed client-server service, in which a client using a
			browser can access a service using a server. However, the service provided is distributed over many locations called sites. Each site holds one or more documents, referred
			to as Web pages. Each Web page, however, can contain some links to other Web pages
			in the same or other sites. In other words, a Web page can be simple or composite. A
			simple Web page has no link to other Web pages; a composite Web page has one or
			more links to other Web pages. Each Web page is a file with a name and address. 
		</p>
		<p class="new">
			<img src="images/13.jpeg" />
			The main document and the image are stored in two separate files in the same site (file A
			and file B); the referenced text file is stored in another site (file C). Since we are dealing with
			three different files, we need three transactions if we want to see the whole document. The first
			transaction (request/response) retrieves a copy of the main document (file A), which has a reference (pointer) to the second and the third files. When a copy of the main document is
			retrieved and browsed, the user can click on the reference to the image to invoke the second
			transaction and retrieve a copy of the image (file B). If the user further needs to see the contents
			of the referenced text file, she can click on its reference (pointer) invoking the third transaction
			and retrieving a copy of the file C. Note that although files A and B both are stored in site I,
			they are independent files with different names and addresses. Two transactions are needed to
			retrieve them.
